# print_passwordsafe
Python code to convert a password safe to a Markdown document.

This can then be printed out for a hard copy.  

# Why?
In my office I use password safe and I have it backed up.  

However even though they have instructions it is beyond the 
rest of the office so they will only use a paper record.

# Test safe
